        batch_x: Batch of xs, used to infer dimensionality and (optional) z-scoring.
        batch_y: Batch of ys, used to infer dimensionality and (optional) z-scoring.
        z_score_x: Whether to z-score xs passing into the network, can be one of:
            - `none`, or None: do not z-score.
            - `independent`: z-score each dimension independently.
            - `structured`: treat dimensions as related, therefore compute mean and std
            over the entire batch, instead of per-dimension. Should be used when each
            sample is, for example, a time series or an image.
        z_score_y: Whether to z-score ys passing into the network, same options as
            z_score_x.
        hidden_features: The number of hidden features in the flow. Defaults to 50.
        num_transforms: The number of transformations in the flow. Defaults to 5.
        embedding_net: The embedding network to use. Defaults to nn.Identity().
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the flow constructor.

        ZukoFlow: The constructed Zuko normalizing flow model.

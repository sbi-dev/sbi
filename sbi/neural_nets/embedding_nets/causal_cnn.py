    Creates a non-causal 1D CNN aggregator based on the WaveNet speach recognition task

    By default this function creates an aggregator with two CNN layers,

    A global average pooling operation is applied in the end. The dimension of the

        This is a simplified version of the architecture introduced for
        the speech recognition task in the WaveNet paper (van den Oord, et al. (2016))

        After several dilated causal convolutions (that maintain the dimensionality
        of the input), an aggregator network is used to bring down the dimensionality.
        You can provide an aggregator network that you deem reasonable for your data.
        If you do not provide an aggregator network yourself, a default aggregator
        is used. This default aggregator is based on the WaveNet paper's description
        of their Speech Recognition Task, and uses non-causal convolutions and pooling
        layers, and global average poolingg to obtain a final low dimensional embedding.

        Args:
            input_shape: Dimensionality of the input e.g. (num_timepoints,),
                currently only 1D is supported.
            in_channels: Number of input channels, default = 1.
            out_channels_per_layer: number of out_channels for each layer, number
                of entries should correspond with num_conv_layers passed below.
                Default = 16 in every convolutional layer.
            dilation: type of dilation to use either one of "none" (dilation = 1
                in every layer), "exponential" (increase dilation by a factor of 2
                every layer), "exponential_cyclic" (as exponential, but reset to 1
                after dilation = 2**9) or pass a list with dilation size per layer.
                By default the cyclic, exponential scheme from WaveNet is used.
            num_conv_layers: the number of causal convolutional layers
            kernel_size: size of the kernels in the causal convolutional layers.
            activation: activation function to use between convolutions,
                default = LeakyReLU.
            pool_kernel_size: pool size to use for the AvgPool1d operation after
                the causal convolutional layers.
            aggregator: aggregation net that reduces the dimensionality of the data
                to a low-dimensional embedding.
            output_dim: number of output units in the final layer when using

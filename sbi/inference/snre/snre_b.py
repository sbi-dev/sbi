        Args:
            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the
                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them. Any
                object with `.log_prob()`and `.sample()` (for example, a PyTorch
                distribution) can be used.
            classifier: Classifier trained to approximate likelihood ratios. If it is
                a string, use a pre-configured network of the provided type (one of
                linear, mlp, resnet). Alternatively, a function that builds a custom
                neural network can be provided. The function will be called with the
                first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can thus be used for shape
                inference and potentially for z-scoring. It needs to return a PyTorch
                `nn.Module` implementing the classifier.
            device: torch device on which to compute, e.g. gpu, cpu.
            logging_level: Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings
                INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL.
            summary_writer: A tensorboard `SummaryWriter` to control, among others, log
                file location (default is `<current working directory>/logs`.)
            show_progress_bars: Whether to show a progressbar during simulation and
                sampling.
            unused_args: Absorbs additional arguments. No entries will be used. If it
                is not empty, we warn. In future versions, when the new interface of
                0.14.0 is more mature, we will remove this argument.

        Args:
            num_atoms: Number of atoms to use for classification.
            training_batch_size: Training batch size.
            learning_rate: Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
            validation_fraction: The fraction of data to use for validation.
            stop_after_epochs: The number of epochs to wait for improvement on the
                validation set before terminating training.
            max_num_epochs: Maximum number of epochs to run. If reached, we stop
                training even when the validation loss is still decreasing. If None, we
                train until validation loss increases (see also `stop_after_epochs`).
            clip_max_norm: Value at which to clip the total gradient norm in order to
                prevent exploding gradients. Use None for no clipping.
            exclude_invalid_x: Whether to exclude simulation outputs `x=NaN` or `x=±∞`
                during training. Expect errors, silent or explicit, when `False`.
            resume_training: Can be used in case training time is limited, e.g. on a
                cluster. If `True`, the split between train and validation set, the
                optimizer, the number of epochs, and the best validation log-prob will
                be restored from the last time `.train()` was called.
            discard_prior_samples: Whether to discard samples simulated in round 1, i.e.
                from the prior. Training may be sped up by ignoring such less targeted
                samples.
            retrain_from_scratch_each_round: Whether to retrain the conditional density
                estimator for the posterior from scratch each round.
            show_train_summary: Whether to print the number of epochs and validation
                loss and leakage after the training.
            dataloader_kwargs: Additional or updated kwargs to be passed to the training
                and validation dataloaders (like, e.g., a collate_fn)

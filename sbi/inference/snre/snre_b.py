        Args:
            simulator: A function that takes parameters $\theta$ and maps them to
                simulations, or observations, `x`, $\mathrm{sim}(\theta)\to x$. Any
                regular Python callable (i.e. function or class with `__call__` method)
                can be used.
            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the
                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them. Any
                object with `.log_prob()`and `.sample()` (for example, a PyTorch
                distribution) can be used.
            num_workers: Number of parallel workers to use for simulations.
            simulation_batch_size: Number of parameter sets that the simulator
                maps to data x at once. If None, we simulate all parameter sets at the
                same time. If >= 1, the simulator has to process data of shape
                (simulation_batch_size, parameter_dimension).
            classifier: Classifier trained to approximate likelihood ratios. If it is
                a string, use a pre-configured network of the provided type (one of
                linear, mlp, resnet). Alternatively, a function that builds a custom
                neural network can be provided. The function will be called with the
                first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can thus be used for shape
                inference and potentially for z-scoring. It needs to return a PyTorch
                `nn.Module` implementing the classifier.
            mcmc_method: Method used for MCMC sampling, one of `slice_np`, `slice`, `hmc`, `nuts`.
                Currently defaults to `slice_np` for a custom numpy implementation of
                slice sampling; select `hmc`, `nuts` or `slice` for Pyro-based sampling.
            mcmc_parameters: Dictionary overriding the default parameters for MCMC.
                The following parameters are supported: `thin` to set the thinning
                factor for the chain, `warmup_steps` to set the initial number of
                samples to discard, `num_chains` for the number of chains, `init_strategy`
                for the initialisation strategy for chains; `prior` will draw init
                locations from prior, whereas `sir` will use Sequential-Importance-
                Resampling using `init_strategy_num_candidates` to find init
                locations.
            device: torch device on which to compute, e.g. gpu, cpu.
            logging_level: Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings
                INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL.
            summary_writer: A `SummaryWriter` to control, among others, log
                file location (default is `<current working directory>/logs`.)
            show_progress_bars: Whether to show a progressbar during simulation and
                sampling.
            show_round_summary: Whether to show the validation loss and leakage after
                each round.

        Return posterior $p(\theta|x)$ after inference (possibly over several rounds).

        Args:
            num_rounds: Number of rounds to run. Each round consists of a simulation and
                training phase. `num_rounds=1` leads to a posterior $p(\theta|x)$ valid
                for _any_ $x$ (amortized), but requires many simulations.
                Alternatively, with `num_rounds>1` the inference returns a posterior
                $p(\theta|x_o)$ focused on a specific observation `x_o`, potentially
                requiring less simulations.
            num_simulations_per_round: Number of simulator calls per round.
            x_o: An observation that is only required when doing inference
                over multiple rounds. After the first round, `x_o` is used to guide the
                sampling so that the simulator is run with parameters that are likely
                for that `x_o`, i.e. they are sampled from the posterior obtained in the
                previous round $p(\theta|x_o)$.
            training_batch_size: Training batch size.
            learning_rate: Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
            validation_fraction: The fraction of data to use for validation.
            stop_after_epochs: The number of epochs to wait for improvement on the
                validation set before terminating training.
            max_num_epochs: Maximum number of epochs to run. If reached, we stop
                training even when the validation loss is still decreasing. If None, we
                train until validation loss increases (see also `stop_after_epochs`).
            clip_max_norm: Value at which to clip the total gradient norm in order to
                prevent exploding gradients. Use None for no clipping.
            exclude_invalid_x: Whether to exclude simulation outputs `x=NaN` or `x=±∞`
                during training. Expect errors, silent or explicit, when `False`.
            discard_prior_samples: Whether to discard samples simulated in round 1, i.e.
                from the prior. Training may be sped up by ignoring such less targeted
                samples.
            retrain_from_scratch_each_round: Whether to retrain the conditional density
                estimator for the posterior from scratch each round.

        Returns:
            Posterior $p(\theta|x)$ that can be sampled and evaluated.

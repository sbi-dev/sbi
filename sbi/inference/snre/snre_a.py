            et al., ICML 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04057

        Args:
            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the
                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them. If `None`, the
                prior must be passed to `.build_posterior()`.
            classifier: Classifier trained to approximate likelihood ratios. If it is
                a string, use a pre-configured network of the provided type (one of
                linear, mlp, resnet). Alternatively, a function that builds a custom
                neural network can be provided. The function will be called with the
                first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can thus be used for shape
                inference and potentially for z-scoring. It needs to return a PyTorch
                `nn.Module` implementing the classifier.
            device: Training device, e.g., "cpu", "cuda" or "cuda:{0, 1, ...}".
            logging_level: Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings
                INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL.
            summary_writer: A tensorboard `SummaryWriter` to control, among others, log
                file location (default is `<current working directory>/logs`.)
            show_progress_bars: Whether to show a progressbar during simulation and
                sampling.

        Args:
            training_batch_size: Training batch size.
            learning_rate: Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
            validation_fraction: The fraction of data to use for validation.
            stop_after_epochs: The number of epochs to wait for improvement on the
                validation set before terminating training.
            max_num_epochs: Maximum number of epochs to run. If reached, we stop
                training even when the validation loss is still decreasing. Otherwise,
                we train until validation loss increases (see also `stop_after_epochs`).
            clip_max_norm: Value at which to clip the total gradient norm in order to
                prevent exploding gradients. Use None for no clipping.
            resume_training: Can be used in case training time is limited, e.g. on a
                cluster. If `True`, the split between train and validation set, the
                optimizer, the number of epochs, and the best validation log-prob will
                be restored from the last time `.train()` was called.
            discard_prior_samples: Whether to discard samples simulated in round 1, i.e.
                from the prior. Training may be sped up by ignoring such less targeted
                samples.
            retrain_from_scratch: Whether to retrain the conditional density
                estimator for the posterior from scratch each round.
            show_train_summary: Whether to print the number of epochs and validation
                loss and leakage after the training.
            dataloader_kwargs: Additional or updated kwargs to be passed to the training
                and validation dataloaders (like, e.g., a collate_fn)
            loss_kwargs: Additional or updated kwargs to be passed to the self._loss fn.

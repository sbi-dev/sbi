        [1] _Automatic Posterior Transformation for Likelihood-free Inference_,
            Greenberg et al., ICML 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07488.

        This class implements two loss variants of SNPE-C: the non-atomic and the atomic
        version. The atomic loss of SNPE-C can be used for any density estimator,
        i.e. also for normalizing flows. However, it suffers from leakage issues. On
        the other hand, the non-atomic loss can only be used only if the proposal
        distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, the density estimator is a mixture of
        Gaussians, and the prior is either Gaussian or Uniform. It does not suffer from
        leakage issues. At the beginning of each round, we print whether the non-atomic
        or the atomic version is used.

        In this codebase, we will automatically switch to the non-atomic loss if the
        following criteria are fulfilled:<br/>
        - proposal is a `DirectPosterior` with density_estimator `mdn`, as built
            with `utils.sbi.posterior_nn()`.<br/>
        - the density estimator is a `mdn`, as built with
            `utils.sbi.posterior_nn()`.<br/>
        - `isinstance(prior, MultivariateNormal)` (from `torch.distributions`) or
            `isinstance(prior, sbi.utils.BoxUniform)`

        Note that custom implementations of any of these densities (or estimators) will
        not trigger the non-atomic loss, and the algorithm will fall back onto using
        the atomic loss.

        Args:
            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the
                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them. Any
                object with `.log_prob()`and `.sample()` (for example, a PyTorch
                distribution) can be used.
            density_estimator: If it is a string, use a pre-configured network of the
                provided type (one of nsf, maf, mdn, made). Alternatively, a function
                that builds a custom neural network can be provided. The function will
                be called with the first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can
                thus be used for shape inference and potentially for z-scoring. It
                needs to return a PyTorch `nn.Module` implementing the density
                estimator. The density estimator needs to provide the methods
                `.log_prob` and `.sample()`.
            device: torch device on which to compute, e.g. gpu, cpu.
            logging_level: Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings
                INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL.
            summary_writer: A tensorboard `SummaryWriter` to control, among others, log
                file location (default is `<current working directory>/logs`.)
            show_progress_bars: Whether to show a progressbar during training.
            unused_args: Absorbs additional arguments. No entries will be used. If it
                is not empty, we warn. In future versions, when the new interface of
                0.14.0 is more mature, we will remove this argument.

            training_batch_size: Training batch size.
            learning_rate: Learning rate for Adam optimizer.
            validation_fraction: The fraction of data to use for validation.
            stop_after_epochs: The number of epochs to wait for improvement on the
                validation set before terminating training.
            max_num_epochs: Maximum number of epochs to run. If reached, we stop
                training even when the validation loss is still decreasing. If None, we
                train until validation loss increases (see also `stop_after_epochs`).
            clip_max_norm: Value at which to clip the total gradient norm in order to
                prevent exploding gradients. Use None for no clipping.
            calibration_kernel: A function to calibrate the loss with respect to the
                simulations `x`. See Lueckmann, Gonçalves et al., NeurIPS 2017.
            exclude_invalid_x: Whether to exclude simulation outputs `x=NaN` or `x=±∞`
                during training. Expect errors, silent or explicit, when `False`.
            resume_training: Can be used in case training time is limited, e.g. on a
                cluster. If `True`, the split between train and validation set, the
                optimizer, the number of epochs, and the best validation log-prob will
                be restored from the last time `.train()` was called.
            discard_prior_samples: Whether to discard samples simulated in round 1, i.e.
                from the prior. Training may be sped up by ignoring such less targeted
                samples.
            use_combined_loss: Whether to train the neural net also on prior samples
                using maximum likelihood in addition to training it on all samples using
                atomic loss. The extra MLE loss helps prevent density leaking with
                bounded priors.
            retrain_from_scratch_each_round: Whether to retrain the conditional density
                estimator for the posterior from scratch each round.
            show_train_summary: Whether to print the number of epochs and validation
                loss and leakage after the training.
            dataloader_kwargs: Additional or updated kwargs to be passed to the training
                and validation dataloaders (like, e.g., a collate_fn)

        Returns the MoG parameters of the proposal posterior.

        The proposal posterior is:
        $pp(\theta|x) = 1/Z * q(\theta|x) * prop(\theta) / p(\theta)$
        In words: proposal posterior = posterior estimate * proposal / prior.

        If the posterior estimate and the proposal are MoG and the prior is either
        Gaussian or uniform, we can solve this in closed-form. The is implemented in
        this function.

        This function implements Appendix A1 from Greenberg et al. 2019.

        We have to build L*K components. How do we do this?
        Example: proposal has two components, density estimator has three components.
        Let's call the two components of the proposal i,j and the three components
        of the density estimator x,y,z. We have to multiply every component of the
        proposal with every component of the density estimator. So, what we do is:
        1) for the proposal, build: i,i,i,j,j,j. Done with torch.repeat_interleave()
        2) for the density estimator, build: x,y,z,x,y,z. Done with torch.repeat()
        3) Multiply them with simple matrix operations.

        Args:
            logits_p: Component weight of each Gaussian of the proposal.
            means_p: Mean of each Gaussian of the proposal.
            precisions_p: Precision matrix of each Gaussian of the proposal.
            logits_d: Component weight for each Gaussian of the density estimator.
            means_d: Mean of each Gaussian of the density estimator.
            precisions_d: Precision matrix of each Gaussian of the density estimator.

        Returns: (Component weight, mean, precision matrix, covariance matrix) of each
            Gaussian of the proposal posterior. Has L*K terms (proposal has L terms,
            density estimator has K terms).

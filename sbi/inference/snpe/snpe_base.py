            discard_prior_samples: Whether to discard samples simulated in round 1, i.e.
                from the prior. Training may be sped up by ignoring such less targeted
                samples.

                estimator for the posterior from scratch each round.

                loss after the training.

                and validation dataloaders (like, e.g., a collate_fn)

        r"""Build posterior from the neural density estimator.

        For SNPE, the posterior distribution that is returned here implements the
        following functionality over the raw neural density estimator:
        - correct the calculation of the log probability such that it compensates for
            the leakage.
        - reject samples that lie outside of the prior bounds.
        - alternatively, if leakage is very high (which can happen for multi-round
            SNPE), sample from the posterior with MCMC.

        Args:
            density_estimator: The density estimator that the posterior is based on.
                If `None`, use the latest neural density estimator that was trained.
            prior: Prior distribution.
            sample_with: Method to use for sampling from the posterior. Must be one of
                [`mcmc` | `rejection` | `vi`].
            mcmc_method: Method used for MCMC sampling, one of `slice_np`, `slice`,
                `hmc`, `nuts`. Currently defaults to `slice_np` for a custom numpy
                implementation of slice sampling; select `hmc`, `nuts` or `slice` for
                Pyro-based sampling.
            vi_method: Method used for VI, one of [`rKL`, `fKL`, `IW`, `alpha`]. Note
                some of the methods admit a `mode seeking` property (e.g. rKL) whereas
                some admit a `mass covering` one (e.g fKL).
            mcmc_parameters: Additional kwargs passed to `MCMCPosterior`.
            vi_parameters: Additional kwargs passed to `VIPosterior`.
            rejection_sampling_parameters: Additional kwargs passed to
                `RejectionPosterior` or `DirectPosterior`. By default,
                `DirectPosterior` is used. Only if `rejection_sampling_parameters`
                contains `proposal`, a `RejectionPosterior` is instantiated.

        Returns:
            Posterior $p(\theta|x)$  with `.sample()` and `.log_prob()` methods
            (the returned log-probability is unnormalized).

                callable that implements the `VectorFieldEstimatorBuilder` protocol

        Note that this is the same as the NPSE posterior, but the sample_with method
        is set to "ode" by default.

        For FMPE, the posterior distribution that is returned here implements
        the following functionality over the raw neural density estimator:
            - correct the calculation of the log probability such that
              samples outside of the prior bounds have log probability -inf.
            - reject samples that lie outside of the prior bounds.

        Args:
            vector_field_estimator: The flow matching estimator that
                the posterior is based on. If `None`, use the latest neural
                flow matching estimator that was trained.
            prior: Prior distribution.
            sample_with: Method to use for sampling from the posterior.
                Can be one of 'sde' (default) or 'ode'. The 'sde' method uses
                the score to do a Langevin diffusion step, while the 'ode' method
                uses the score to define a probabilistic ODE and solves it with
                a numerical ODE solver.

                `VectorFieldBasedPotential`.

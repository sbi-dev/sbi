        [1] _Flexible statistical inference for mechanistic models of neural dynamics_,

            https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01861.

        Like all NPE methods, this method trains a deep neural density estimator to
        directly approximate the posterior. Also like all other NPE methods, in the
        first round, this density estimator is trained with a maximum-likelihood loss.

        This class implements NPE-B. NPE-B trains across multiple rounds with a
        an importance-weighted log-loss. Unlike NPE-A the loss will make training
        directly converge to the true posterior.
        Thus, SNPE-B is not limited to Gaussian proposal.

        Args:
            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the
                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them.
            density_estimator: If it is a string, use a pre-configured network of the
                provided type (one of nsf, maf, mdn, made). Alternatively, a function
                that builds a custom neural network can be provided. The function will
                be called with the first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can
                thus be used for shape inference and potentially for z-scoring. It
                needs to return a PyTorch `nn.Module` implementing the density
                estimator. The density estimator needs to provide the methods
                `.log_prob` and `.sample()`.
            device: Training device, e.g., "cpu", "cuda" or "cuda:{0, 1, ...}".
            logging_level: Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings
                INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL.
            summary_writer: A tensorboard `SummaryWriter` to control, among others, log
                file location (default is `<current working directory>/logs`.)
            show_progress_bars: Whether to show a progressbar during training.

        Base class for Neural Posterior Score Estimation methods.

        Instead of performing conditonal *density* estimation, NPSE methods perform
        conditional *score* estimation i.e. they estimate the gradient of the log
        density using denoising score matching loss.

        NOTE: NPSE does not support multi-round inference with flexible proposals yet.
        You can try to run multi-round with truncated proposals, but note that this is
        not tested yet.

        Args:
            prior: Prior distribution.
            score_estimator: Neural network architecture for the
                vector field estimator. Can be a string (e.g. 'mlp' or 'ada_mlp') or a
                callable that implements the `VectorFieldEstimatorBuilder` protocol
                with `__call__` that receives `theta` and `x` and returns a
                `ConditionalVectorFieldEstimator`.
            sde_type: Type of SDE to use. Must be one of ['vp', 've', 'subvp'].
            device: Device to run the training on.
            logging_level: Logging level for the training. Can be an integer or a
                string.
            summary_writer: Tensorboard summary writer.
            show_progress_bars: Whether to show progress bars during training.
            kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the default builder if
                `score_estimator` is a string.

        r"""Build posterior from the vector field estimator.

        Note that this is the same as the FMPE posterior, but the sample_with
        method is set to "sde" by default.

        For NPSE, the posterior distribution that is returned here implements
        the following functionality over the raw neural density estimator:
            - correct the calculation of the log probability such that
              samples outside of the prior bounds have log probability -inf.
            - reject samples that lie outside of the prior bounds.

        Args:
            vector_field_estimator: The vector field estimator that the posterior is
                based on. If `None`, use the latest vector field estimator that was
                trained.
            prior: Prior distribution.
            sample_with: Method to use for sampling from the posterior. Can be one of
                'sde' (default) or 'ode'. The 'sde' method uses the score to
                do a Langevin diffusion step, while the 'ode' method solves a
                probabilistic ODE with a numerical ODE solver.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to
                `VectorFieldBasedPotential`.


        Returns:
            Posterior $p(\theta|x)$  with `.sample()` and `.log_prob()` methods.

    are considered to be from two different generating PDFs.

    Training of the classifier with N-fold cross-validation [3] using sklearn. By
    default, a `RandomForestClassifier` by from `sklearn.ensemble` is used (<classifier>
    = 'rf'). Alternatively, a multi-layer perceptron is available (<classifier> =
    'mlp'). For a small study on the pros and cons for this choice see [4]. Before both
    samples are ingested, they are normalized (z scored) under the assumption that each
    dimension in X follows a normal distribution, i.e. the mean(X) is subtracted from X
    and this difference is divided by std(X) for every dimension.

    If you need a more flexible interface which is able to take a sklearn compatible
    classifier and more, see the `c2st_` method in this module.

    This function performs training of the classifier with N-fold cross-validation [3]

    used which is recommended based on the study performed in [4]. This can be changed

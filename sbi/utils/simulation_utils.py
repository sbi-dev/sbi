    r"""Returns ($\theta, x$) pairs obtained from sampling the proposal and simulating.

    This function performs two steps:

    - Sample parameters $\theta$ from the `proposal`.
    - Simulate these parameters to obtain $x$.

    Args:
        simulator: A function that takes parameters $\theta$ and maps them to
            simulations, or observations, `x`, $\text{sim}(\theta)\to x$. Any
            regular Python callable (i.e. function or class with `__call__` method)
            can be used. Note that the simulator should be able to handle numpy
            arrays for efficient parallelization. You can use
            `process_simulator` to ensure this.
        proposal: Probability distribution that the parameters $\theta$ are sampled
            from.
        num_simulations: Number of simulations that are run.
        num_workers: Number of parallel workers to use for simulations.
        simulation_batch_size: Number of parameter sets of shape
            (simulation_batch_size, parameter_dimension) that the simulator
            receives per call. If None, we set
            simulation_batch_size=num_simulations and simulate all parameter
            sets with one call. Otherwise, we construct batches of parameter
            sets and distribute them among num_workers.
        seed: Seed for reproducibility.
        show_progress_bar: Whether to show a progress bar for simulating. This will not
            affect whether there will be a progressbar while drawing samples from the
            proposal.

    Returns: Sampled parameters $\theta$ and simulation-outputs $x$.

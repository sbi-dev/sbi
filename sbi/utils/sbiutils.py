    This is relevant for snpe methods and flows for which the posterior tends to have
     mass outside the prior boundaries.

    This function uses rejection sampling with samples from posterior in order to
        1) obtain posterior samples within the prior support, and
        2) calculate the fraction of accepted samples as a proxy for correcting the
           density during evaluation of the posterior.

    Args:
        posterior_nn: Neural net representing the posterior.
        prior: Distribution-like object that evaluates probabilities with `log_prob`.
        x: Conditioning variable $x$ for the posterior $p(\theta|x)$.
        num_samples: Desired number of samples.
        show_progressbar: Whether to show a progressbar during sampling.
        warn_acceptance: A minimum acceptance rate under which to warn about slowness.

    Returns:
        Accepted samples and acceptance rate as scalar Tensor.

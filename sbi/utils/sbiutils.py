    r"""
    Formats parameters theta and simulation outputs x into shapes that can be processed
     by neural density estimators for the posterior $p(\theta|x)$.

    Neural density estimators require the first dimension of theta and x to
     match, `theta.shape == (N, dim_theta)` and `x.shape == (N, dim_x)`,
     with N being the number of data points where we evaluate the density estimator.
     In this function, we match the shape of x to the shape of theta.
    If x has shape (dim_x) or (1, dim_x), we build
     `x = torch.tensor([x, x,..., x])` such that we can later evaluate
     $p(\theta_n|x)$ for every parameter set $\theta_n$ in theta
    If x is None, we build `x = torch.tensor([x_o, x_o,..., x_o])` such that
     we can later evaluate $p(\theta_n|x_o)$ for every parameter set $\theta_n$ in theta
    If x has shape or (N, dim_x) and theta has shape (N, dim_theta), we leave
     x unaltered as `x = torch.tensor([x_1, x_2,..., x_N])` such that we can
     later evaluate $p(\theta_n|x_n)$ for every parameter set $\theta_n$ in theta with
     n={1,...,N}

    Args:
        theta: parameters $\theta$
        x: conditioning variables $x$. If None, x is ignored.
        x_o: if x=None, replace it with x_o
        correct_for_leakage:
            If True, we normalize the output density
            by drawing samples, estimating the acceptance
            ratio, and then scaling the probability with it

Bayesian inference provides a general and powerful framework to invert the simulators, i.e. describe the parameters which are consistent both with empirical data and prior knowledge.</p> <p>In the case of simulators, a key quantity required for statistical inference, the likelihood of observed data given parameters, \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = p(x_o|\\theta)\\), is typically intractable, rendering conventional statistical approaches inapplicable.</p> <p><code>sbi</code> implements powerful machine-learning methods that address this problem. Roughly, these algorithms can be categorized as:</p> <ul> <li>Neural Posterior Estimation (amortized <code>NPE</code> and sequential <code>SNPE</code>),</li> <li>Neural Likelihood Estimation (<code>(S)NLE</code>), and</li> <li>Neural Ratio Estimation (<code>(S)NRE</code>).</li> </ul> <p>Depending on the characteristics of the problem, e.g. the dimensionalities of the parameter space and the observation space, one of the methods will be more suitable.</p> <p></p> <p>Goal: Algorithmically identify mechanistic models which are consistent with data.</p> <p>Each of the methods above needs three inputs: A candidate mechanistic model, prior knowledge or constraints on model parameters, and observational data (or summary statistics thereof).</p> <p>The methods then proceed by</p> <ol> <li>sampling parameters from the prior followed by simulating synthetic data from    these parameters,</li> <li>learning the (probabilistic) association between data (or    data features) and underlying parameters, i.e. to learn statistical inference from    simulated data. The way in which this association is learned differs between the    above methods, but all use deep neural networks.</li> <li>This learned neural network is then applied to empirical data to derive the full    space of parameters consistent with the data and the prior, i.e. the posterior    distribution. High posterior probability is assigned to parameters which are    consistent with both the data and the prior, low probability to inconsistent    parameters. While SNPE directly learns the posterior distribution, SNLE and SNRE need    an extra MCMC sampling step to construct a posterior.</li> <li>If needed, an initial estimate of the posterior can be used to adaptively generate    additional informative simulations.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>See Cranmer, Brehmer, Louppe (2020) for a recent review on simulation-based inference.</p> <p>The following papers offer additional details on the inference methods implemented in <code>sbi</code>.

SNPE-A trains across multiple rounds with a\n        maximum-likelihood-loss. This will make training converge to the proposal\n        posterior instead of the true posterior. To correct for this, SNPE-A applies a\n        post-hoc correction after training. This correction has to be performed\n        analytically. Thus, SNPE-A is limited to Gaussian distributions for all but the\n        last round. In the last round, SNPE-A can use a Mixture of Gaussians.\n\n        Args:\n            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the\n                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them.

The function will\n                be called with the first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can\n                thus be used for shape inference and potentially for z-scoring. It\n                needs to return a PyTorch `nn.Module` implementing the density\n                estimator. The density estimator needs to provide the methods\n                `.log_prob` and `.sample()`. Note that until the last round only a\n                single (multivariate) Gaussian component is used for training (see\n                Algorithm 1 in [1]). In the last round, this component is replicated\n                `num_components` times, its parameters are perturbed with a very small\n                noise, and then the last training round is done with the expanded\n                Gaussian mixture as estimator for the proposal posterior.\n            num_components: Number of components of the mixture of Gaussians in the\n                last round.

The atomic loss of SNPE-C can be used for any density estimator,\n        i.e. also for normalizing flows. However, it suffers from leakage issues. On\n        the other hand, the non-atomic loss can only be used only if the proposal\n        distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, the density estimator is a mixture of\n        Gaussians, and the prior is either Gaussian or Uniform. It does not suffer from\n        leakage issues. At the beginning of each round, we print whether the non-atomic\n        or the atomic version is used.\n\n        In this codebase, we will automatically switch to the non-atomic loss if the\n        following criteria are fulfilled:&lt;br/&gt;\n        - proposal is a `DirectPosterior` with density_estimator `mdn`, as built\n            with `utils.sbi.posterior_nn()`.&lt;br/&gt;\n        - the density estimator is a `mdn`, as built with\n            `utils.sbi.posterior_nn()`.&lt;br/&gt;\n        - `isinstance(prior, MultivariateNormal)` (from `torch.distributions`) or\n            `isinstance(prior, sbi.utils.BoxUniform)`\n\n        Note that custom implementations of any of these densities (or estimators) will\n        not trigger the non-atomic loss, and the algorithm will fall back onto using\n        the atomic loss.\n\n        Args:\n            prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the\n                parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them.\n            density_estimator: If it is a string, use a pre-configured network of the\n                provided type (one of nsf, maf, mdn, made).

The function will\n                be called with the first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can\n                thus be used for shape inference and potentially for z-scoring.

Of\n            course, you can also specify your own variational family by passing a\n            `parameterized` distribution object i.e. a torch.distributions\n            Distribution with methods `parameters` returning an iterable of all\n            parameters (you can pass them within the paramters/modules attribute).\n            Additionally, we allow a `Callable`, which allows you the pass a\n            `builder` function, which if called returns an distribution. This may be\n            useful for setting the hyperparameters e.g. `num_transfroms:int` by\n            using the `get_flow_builder` method specifying the hyperparameters.

Once the likelihood is learned on single trials (i.e., a neural network that predicts the likelihood of a single observation given a parameter set), one can sample the posterior for any number of trials. This works because, given a single-trial neural likelihood from (S)NLE or (S)NRE, we can calculate the joint likelihoods of all trials by multiplying them together (or adding them in log-space). The joint likelihood can then be plugged into <code>MCMC</code> or <code>VI</code>. <code>sbi</code> takes care of all of these steps, so you do not have to implement anything yourself:</p> <pre><code># Train SNLE.\ninferer = SNLE(prior, show_progress_bars=True, density_estimator=\"mdn\")\ntheta, x = simulate_for_sbi(simulator, prior, 10000, simulation_batch_size=1000)\ninferer.append_simulations(theta, x).train(training_batch_size=1000);\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Running 10000 simulations.:   0%|          | 0/10000 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]\n\n\n Neural network successfully converged after 43 epochs.\n</code></pre> <pre><code># Obtain posterior samples for different number of iid xos.\nnle_samples = []\nnum_samples = 5000\n\nmcmc_parameters = dict(\n    num_chains=50,\n    thin=10,\n    warmup_steps=50,\n    init_strategy=\"proposal\",\n)\nmcmc_method = \"slice_np_vectorized\"\n\nposterior = inferer.build_posterior(\n    mcmc_method=mcmc_method,\n    mcmc_parameters=mcmc_parameters,\n)\n\n# Generate samples with MCMC given the same set of x_os as above.\nfor xo in xos:\n    nle_samples.append(posterior.sample(sample_shape=(num_samples,), x=xo))\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Running vectorized MCMC with 50 chains:   0%|          | 0/75000 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]\n\n\n/Users/janbolts/qode/sbi/sbi/utils/sbiutils.py:342: UserWarning: An x with a batch size of 5 was passed.

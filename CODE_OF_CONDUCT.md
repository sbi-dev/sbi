This project adheres to the [NumFOCUS Code of
Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to
uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to Jan Boelts via Discord or

## The Short Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember
that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for
NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of
many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless
of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community
members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

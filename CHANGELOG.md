## Breaking changes

- Posteriors saved under `sbi` `v0.17.2` or older can not be loaded under `sbi`
`v0.18.0` or newer.

`.build_posterior(sample_with=...)`. (#573)
- the `posterior` no longer has the the method `.sample_conditional()`. Using this
  feature now requires using the `sampler interface` (see tutorial
  [here](https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/tutorial/07_conditional_distributions/)) (#573)

- API changes that had been introduced in `sbi v0.14.0` and `v0.15.0` are not enforced. Using the interface prior to
  those changes leads to an error (#645)

posterior = inference(num_simulation=1000)
```

```python
from sbi.inference import SNPE, prepare_for_sbi, simulate_for_sbi

simulator, prior = prepare_for_sbi(simulator, prior)
inference = SNPE(prior)

theta, x = simulate_for_sbi(simulator, proposal=prior, num_simulations=1000)
density_estimator = inference.append_simulations(theta, x).train()
posterior = inference.build_posterior(density_estimator)  # MCMC kwargs go here.
```

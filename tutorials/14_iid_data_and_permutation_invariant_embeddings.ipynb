    "# SBI with iid data and permutation-invariant embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are scenarios in which we observe multiple data points per experiment and we can assume that they are independent and identically distributed (iid, i.e., they are assumed to have the same underlying model parameters).\n",
    "For example, in decision-making experiments, the experiment is often repeated in trials with the same experimental settings and conditions. The corresponding set of trials is then assumed to be \"iid\" given a single parameter set.\n",
    "In such a scenario, we may want to obtain the posterior given a set of observation $p(\\theta | X=\\{x_i\\}_i^N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amortization of neural network training: iid-inference with NLE / NRE\n",
    "\n",
    "For some SBI variants the iid assumption can be exploited: when using a likelihood-based SBI method (`SNLE`, `SNRE`) one can train the density or ratio estimator on single-trial data, and then perform inference with `MCMC` or variational inference (`VI`). Crucially, because the data is iid and the estimator is trained on single-trial data, one can repeat the inference with a different `x_o` (a different set of trials, or different number of trials) without having to retrain the density estimator. One can interpet this as amortization of the SBI training: we can obtain a neural likelihood, or likelihood-ratio estimate for new `x_o`s without retraining, but we still have to run `MCMC` or `VI` to do inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, one cannot only change the number of trials of a new `x_o`, but also the entire inference setting.\n",
    "For example, one can apply hierarchical inference with changing hierarchical denpendencies between the model parameters--all without having to retrain the density estimator because it estimates single-trail likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full amortization: iid-inference with NPE and permutation-invariant embedding nets\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing neural posterior estimation (`SNPE`) we cannot exploit the iid assumption directly.\n",
    "Thus, the underlying neural network takes `x` as input and predicts the parameters of the density estimator.\n",
    "As a consequence, if `x` is a set of iid observations $X=\\{x_i\\}_i^N$ then the neural network has to be invariant to permutations of this set, i.e., it has to be permutation invariant. In addition, the neural network has to be able to consume a varying number of iid datapoints in order to be amortized over the number of trials.\n",
    "Therefore, in order to use `SNPE` for inference on iid data, we need to provide a corresponding embedding network that handles the iid-data.\n",
    "This will likely require some hyperparameter tuning and more training data for inference to work accurately. But once we have this, inference is fully amortized, i.e., we can get new posterior samples almost instantly without retraining and without running `MCMC` or `VI`.\n"

    "(S)NLE and (S)NRE can perform inference given multiple IID obserations by using only single-trial training data (i.e., for training, we run the simulator only once per parameter set). Once the likelihood is learned on single trials (i.e., a neural network that predicts the likelihood of a single observation given a parameter set), one can sample the posterior for any number of trials. This works because, given a single-trial neural likelihood from (S)NLE or (S)NRE, we can calculate the joint likelihoods of all trials by multiplying them together (or adding them in log-space). The joint likelihood can then be plugged into `MCMC` or `VI`. `sbi` takes care of all of these steps, so you do not have to implement anything yourself:\n"

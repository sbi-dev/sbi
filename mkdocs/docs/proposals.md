# Enhancement Proposals (EPs)

Enhancement Proposals document and discuss substantial changes to sbi’s API, internals,
or processes. EPs provide context, motivation, and a concrete design for review and
decision-making.

This page serves as an entry point to all EPs and explains how they are organized.

## Process and scope

- EPs are used for larger changes that affect users or maintainers broadly (APIs,
  architecture, governance, tooling).
- Each EP is a standalone Markdown file that explains the motivation, design,
  alternatives, and migration plan if needed.
- EPs are numbered sequentially (EP-00, EP-01, …).
- Status values: Draft → Discussion → Accepted → Implementing → Completed →
  Rejected/Withdrawn. The default is Draft.

## Current EPs

- [EP-00: Enhancement Proposal Process](proposals/ep-00-process.md)
- [EP-01: Pluggable Training Infrastructure for sbi](proposals/ep-01-pluggable-training.md)

If you would like to propose a new EP, open a discussion and a PR adding a new
`proposals/ep-XX-<short-title>.md` file.

For feedback and community discussion, we use [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/discussions/categories/enhancement-proposals).
Each EP page links to its corresponding discussion thread when available.

## Setup

Clone the repo and install all the dependencies using the `environment.yml` file to create a conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`. If you already have an `sbi` environment and want to refresh dependencies, just run `conda env update -f environment.yml --prune`.

Alternatively, you can install via `setup.py` using `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (the dev flag installs development and testing dependencies).

## Examples

Examples are collected in notebooks in `examples/`.

## Binary files and Jupyter notebooks

### Using `sbi`

We use git lfs to store large binary files. Those files are not downloaded by cloning the repository, but you have to pull them separately. To do so follow installation instructions here [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/). In particular, in a freshly cloned repository on a new machine, you will need to run both `git-lfs install` and `git-lfs pull`.

### Contributing to `sbi`

We use a filename filter to track lfs files. Once you installed and pulled git lfs you can add a file to git lfs by appending `_gitlfs` to the basename, e.g., `oldbase_gitlfs.npy`. Then add the file to the index, commit, and it will be tracked by git lfs.

Additionally, to avoid large diffs due to Jupyter notebook outputs we are using `nbstripout` to remove output from notebooks before every commit. The `nbstripout` package is downloaded automatically during installation of `sbi`. However, **please make sure to set up the filter yourself**, e.g., through `nbstriout --install` or with different options as described [here](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout).

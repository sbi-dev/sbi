## Description

Building on code for "On Contrastive Learning for Likelihood-free Inference" in <https://github.com/conormdurkan/lfi.>

Features neural likelihood-free methods from

> Papamakarios et al., _Sequential Neural Likelihood_ (SNL), 2019. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07226)
>Greenberg et al., _Automatic Posterior Transformation_ (SNPE-C), 2019. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07488)
>Hermans et al., _Likelihood-free Inference with Amortized Approximate Likelihood Ratios_ (SRE), 2019.  [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04057)

## Setup

Clone the repo and install all the dependencies using the `environment.yml` file to create a conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

Alternatively, you can install via `setup.py` using `pip install -e.`

Also uses <https://github.com/bayesiains/nsf> for general density estimation, but that directory is included here so you don't need to get it separately (will hopefully be a pip installable package soon, and in PyTorch master some day).  

## Examples

Examples are collected in notebooks in `examples/`.

## Git lfs

We use git lfs to store binary files, e.g., example notebooks. To use git lfs follow installation instructions here <https://git-lfs.github.com/.>

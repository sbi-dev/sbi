## sbi: simulation-based inference

`sbi` is a PyTorch package for simulation-based inference. Simulation-based inference is
the process of finding parameters of a simulator from observations.

`sbi` takes a Bayesian approach and returns a full posterior distribution
over the parameters, conditional on the observations. This posterior can be amortized (i.e.
useful for any observation) or focused (i.e. tailored to a particular observation), with different
computational trade-offs.

`sbi` offers a simple interface for one-line posterior inference.

```python
from sbi.inference import infer
# import your simulator, define your prior over the parameters
parameter_posterior = infer(simulator, prior, method='SNPE', num_simulations=100)
```
See below for the available methods of inference, `SNPE`, `SNRE` and `SNLE`.


## Installation

`sbi` requires Python 3.7 or higher. It can be installed using `pip`:
```commandline
$ pip install sbi
```

We recommend to use a [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) virtual
environment ([Miniconda installation instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html])). If `conda` is installed on the system, an environment for
installing `sbi` can be created as follows:
```commandline
# Create an environment for sbi (indicate Python 3.7 or higher); activate it
$ conda create -n sbi_env python=3.7 && conda activate sbi_env
```

To test the installation, drop into a python prompt and run
```python
from sbi.examples.minimal import simple
posterior = simple()
print(posterior)
```

## Acknowledgements

`sbi` is the successor (using PyTorch) of the
[`delfi`](https://github.com/mackelab/delfi) package. It was started as a fork of Conor
M. Durkan's `lfi`. `sbi` runs as a community project; development is coordinated at the
[mackelab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/professorships/machine-learning-in-science/). See also [credits](https://github.com/mackelab/sbi/blob/master/docs/docs/credits.md).


## Support

`sbi` has been developed in the context of the [ADIMEM
grant](https://fit.uni-tuebingen.de/Activity/Details?id=6097), project A. ADIMEM is a
BMBF grant awarded to groups at the Technical University of Munich, University of
Tübingen and Research Center caesar of the Max Planck Gesellschaft.

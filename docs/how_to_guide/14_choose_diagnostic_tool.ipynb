    "`sbi` implements a range of diagnostic tools. Here, we provide an overview of what they do:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **expected coverage**: allows you to evaluate whether the joint posterior is over- or under-confident (on average across prior predictives). Unlike SBC (see below), it can also identify issues in posterior correlation. Requires relatively few additional simulations (~300).\n",
    "- **simulation-based calibration** (SBC): allows you to evaluate, for every parameter, whether it is too narrow, too wide, or skewed (on average across prior predictives). Requires relatively few additional simulations (~300).\n",
    "- **TARP**: can provide a sufficient condition for the posterior to be correct, but requires tuning additional hyperparameters (which can make the diagnostic tool less powerful if chosen poorly)\n",
    "- **L-C2ST**: can provide a sufficient condition for the posterior for a specific observation to be correct. However, it requires training an additional neural network, and poor convergence of that neural network can make the diagnostic less powerful. Requires many additional simulations (>1k) to train the additional neural network.\n",
    "- **model misspecification checks**: These diagnostic tools are different from all other methods: they do _not_ evaluate the quality of the posterior. Instead, they evaluate whether the observation can be generated by the simulator. If these checks fail, then any `sbi` method will likely perform poorly."

    "# How to run sequential methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we have inferred the posterior using **amortized inference**. In **amortized inference**, we draw parameters from the prior, simulate the corresponding data, and then train a neural network to obtain the posterior. However, if one is interested in only one particular observation `x_o` sampling from the prior can be inefficient in the number of simulations because one is effectively learning a posterior estimate for all observations in the prior space. In this tutorial, we show how one can alleviate this issue by using **sequential methods** with `sbi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential methods** also starts by drawing parameters from the prior, simulating them, and training a neural network to estimate the posterior distribution. Afterwards, however, it continues inference in multiple rounds, focusing on a particular observation `x_o`. In each new round of inference, it draws samples from the obtained posterior distribution conditioned at `x_o` (instead of from the prior), simulates these, and trains the network again. This process can be repeated arbitrarily often to get increasingly good approximations to the true posterior distribution at `x_o`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running multi-round inference can be more efficient in the number of simulations, but it will lead to the posterior no longer being amortized (i.e. it will be accurate only for a specific observation `x_o`, not for any `x`).\n"

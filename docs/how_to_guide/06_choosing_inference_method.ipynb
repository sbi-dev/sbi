    "**`NPE`** is the only method which estimates the posterior directly. This means that it will not require further sampling steps (such as MCMC) _after_ training. This makes NPE the fastest to `.sample()` from the posterior estimate after training. In addition, it can use an embedding network to learn summary statistics (just like NRE, but unlike NLE), see the tutorial [here]().\n",
    "\n",
    "**`NLE`** learns the likelihood. This allows NLE to emulate the simulator after training. To sample from the posterior, NLE is combined with MCMC or variational inference (see [here]()), which makes it slower to `.sample()`. An advantage of NLE is that, if you have multiple iid observations, then it can be much more simulation efficient than NPE (see tutorial [here]()).\n",

    "**`NRE`** learns the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. It trains only a classifier (unlike NPE and NLE, which train a generative model), which makes it fastest to train. Like NLE, NRE has to be combined MCMC or variational inference to run `.sample()`. Like NPE, NRE can use an embedding network to learn summary statistics."

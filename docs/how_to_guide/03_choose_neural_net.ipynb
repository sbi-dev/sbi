    "- When your simulation outputs are high-dimensional (e.g., images, time-series,...), we strongly recommend using an embedding net, as described [here]().\n",
    "- For `NPE` and `NLE`, the `nsf` density estimator often outperforms the default (`maf`), but it is slower to train and may be more prone to overfitting. This can be done by setting `trainer = NPE(density_estimator=\"nsf\")`.\n",
    "- For best performance, optimize the hyperparameters of `sbi`, as described [here]()."

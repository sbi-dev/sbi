    "`sbi` implements a wide range of neural networks for the different inference methods. By and large, we expect that the default choices of `sbi` perform well. This tutorial describes how you can optimize the performance of `sbi` by choosing the best neural net.\n",

    "- When your simulation outputs are high-dimensional (e.g., images, time-series,...), we strongly recommend using an embedding net, as described [here](https://sbi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guide/04_embedding_networks.html).\n",
    "- For `NPE` and `NLE`, the `nsf` density estimator often outperforms the default (`maf`), but it is slower to train and may be more prone to overfitting. This can be done by setting `trainer = NPE(density_estimator=\"nsf\")`.\n",
    "- For best performance, optimize the hyperparameters of `sbi`."

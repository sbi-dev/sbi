    "Similar to expected coverage, simulation-based calibration (SBC) provides a simple and interpretable tool to diagnose issues in the posterior. It also requires relatively few additional simulations (~200) and it does not rely on any additional hyperparameters (as TARP would) or additional neural network training.\n",

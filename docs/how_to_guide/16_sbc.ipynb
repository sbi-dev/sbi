    "Similar to expected coverage, simulation-based calibration (SBC) provides a simple and interpretable tool to diagnose issues in the posterior. It also requires relatively few additional simulations (~200) and it does not rely on any additional hyperparameters (as TARP would) or additional neural network training.\n",

    "SBC allows you to evaluate whether individual marginals of the posterior are, on average across many observations (prior predictive samples) too narrow, too wide, or skewed.\n",

=========

Before running the notebooks, follow our instructions to
`install sbi <https://sbi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.
Alternatively, you can also open a `codespace on
GitHub <https://codespaces.new/sbi-dev/sbi>`_ and work through the tutorials in
the browser. The numbers of the notebooks are not informative of the order,
please follow this structure depending on which group you identify with.

Once you have familiarised yourself with the methods and identified how to apply
SBI to your use case, you can check out our [how-to guide]() for brief answers to
specific questions and our [advanced tutorials]() for longer explanations of particular
features.

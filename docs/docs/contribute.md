# How to contribute

!!! important

    By participating in the `sbi` community, all members are expected to comply with
    our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md). This ensures a positive and inclusive
    environment for everyone involved.

## User experiences, bugs, and feature requests

If you are using `sbi` to infer the parameters of a simulator, we would be
delighted to know how it worked for you. If it didn't work according to plan,
please open up an [issue](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/issues) or
[discussion](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/discussions) and tell us more about
your use case: the dimensionality of the input parameters and of the output,
as well as the setup you used to run inference (i.e., number of simulations,
number of rounds, etc.).

To report bugs and suggest features -- including better documentation --
please equally head over to [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/issues)
and tell us everything.

## Contributing code

Contributions to the `sbi` package are always welcome! The preferred way to do
it is via pull requests onto our [main repository](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi).
To give credit to contributors, we consider adding contributors who repeatedly
and substantially contributed to `sbi` to the list of authors of the package at
the end of every year. Additionally, we mention all contributors in the releases.

!!! note
    To avoid doing duplicated work, we strongly suggest that you go take
    a look at our current [open issues](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/issues) and
    [pull requests](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi/pulls) to see if someone else is
    already doing it. Also, in case you're planning to work on something that has not
    yet been proposed by others (e.g. adding a new feature, adding a new example),
    it is preferable to first open a new issue explaining what you intend to
    propose and then working on your pull request after getting some feedback from
    others.

### How to contribute

The following steps describe all parts of the workflow for doing a contribution such as
installing locally `sbi` from source, creating a `conda` environment, setting up
your `git` repository, etc. We've taken strong inspiration from the guides for
contribution of [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html)
and [`mne`](https://mne.tools/stable/development/contributing.html):

**Step 1**: [Create an account](https://github.com/) on GitHub if you do not
already have one.

**Step 2**: Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi): click
on the ‘Fork’ button near the top of the page. This will create a copy of the
`sbi` codebase under your GitHub user account. See more details on how to fork
a repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

**Step 3**: Clone your fork of the `sbi` repo from your GitHub account to your
local disk:
```
git clone git@github.com:$USERNAME/sbi.git
cd sbi
```

**Step 4**: Install a recent version of Python (we currently recommend 3.10)
for instance using [`miniforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). We
strongly recommend you create a specific `conda` environment for doing
development on `sbi` as per:
```
conda create -n sbi_dev python=3.10
conda activate sbi_dev
```

**Step 5**: Install `sbi` in editable mode with
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
This installs the `sbi` package into the current environment by creating a
link to the source code directory (instead of copying the code to pip’s `site_packages`
directory, which is what normally happens). This means that any edits you make
to the `sbi` source code will be reflected the next time you open a Python interpreter
and `import sbi` (the `-e` flag of pip stands for an “editable” installation,
and the `dev` flag installs development and testing dependencies). This requires
at least Python 3.8.

**Step 6**: Add the upstream remote. This saves a reference to the main `sbi`
repository, which you can use to keep your repository synchronized with the latest
changes:
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:sbi-dev/sbi.git
```
Check that the upstream and origin remote aliases are configured correctly by
running `git remote -v` which should display:
```
origin  git@github.com:$USERNAME/sbi.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:$USERNAME/sbi.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:sbi-dev/sbi.git (fetch)
upstream        git@github.com:sbi-dev/sbi.git (push)
```

**Step 7**: Install `pre-commit` to run code style checks before each commit:
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

You should now have a working installation of `sbi` and a git repository
properly configured for making contributions. The following steps describe the
process of modifying code and submitting a pull request:

**Step 8**: Synchronize your main branch with the upstream/main branch. See more
details on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork):
```
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

**Step 9**: Create a feature branch to hold your development changes:
```
git checkout -b my_feature
```
and start making changes. Always use a feature branch! It’s good practice
to never work on the main branch, as this allows you to easily get back to a
working state of the code if needed (e.g., if you’re working on multiple
changes at once, or need to pull in recent changes from someone else to get
your new feature to work properly). In most cases you should make PRs into the
upstream’s main branch.

**Step 10**: Develop your code on your feature branch on the computer, using
Git to do the version control. When you’re done editing, add changed files
using `git add` and then `git commit` to record your changes:
```
git add modified_files
git commit -m "description of your commit"
```
Then push the changes to your GitHub account with:
```
git push -u origin my_feature
```
The `-u` flag ensures that your local branch will be automatically linked with
the remote branch, so you can later use `git push` and `git pull` without any
extra arguments.

**Step 11**: Follow [these](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
instructions to create a pull request from your fork.
This will send a notification to `sbi` maintainers and trigger reviews and comments
regarding your contribution.

!!! note
    It is often helpful to keep your local feature branch synchronized
    with the latest changes of the main `sbi` repository:
    ```
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    ```

### Style conventions and testing

All our docstrings and comments are written following the [Google
Style](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

For code linting and formating, we use [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/),
which is installed alongside `sbi`.

You can exclude slow tests and those which require a GPU with
```
pytest -m "not slow and not gpu"
```
Additionally, we recommend to run tests with
```
pytest -n auto -m "not slow and not gpu"
```
in parallel. GPU tests should probably not be run this way. If you see unexpected
behavior (tests fail if they shouldn't), try to run them without `-n auto` and
see if it persists. When writing new tests and debugging things, it may make sense
to also run them without `-n auto`.

When you create a PR onto `main`, our Continuous Integration (CI) actions on
GitHub will perform the following checks:

- **`ruff`** for linting and formatting (including `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`)
- **[`pyright`](https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright)** for static type checking.
- **`pytest`** for running a subset of fast tests from our test suite.

If any of these fail, try reproducing and solving the error locally:

- **`ruff`**: Make sure you have `pre-commit` installed locally with the same
 version as specified in the [requirements](pyproject.toml). Execute it
 using `pre-commit run --all-files`. `ruff` tends to give informative error
  messages that help you fix the problem. Note that pre-commit only detects
  problems with `ruff` linting and formatting, but does not fix them. You can
  fix them either by running `ruff check . --fix(linting)`, followed by
  `ruff format . --fix(formatting)`, or by hand.
- **`pyright`**: Run it locally using `pyright sbi/` and ensure you are using
the same
  `pyright` version as used in the CI (which is the case if you have installed
  it with `pip install -e ".[dev]"` but note that you have to rerun it once
  someone updates the version in the `pyproject.toml`).
  - Known issues and fixes:
    - If using `**kwargs`, you either have to specify all possible types of
    `kwargs`, e.g. `**kwargs: Union[int, boolean]` or use `**kwargs: Any`
- **`pytest`**: On GitHub Actions you can see which test failed. Reproduce it
locally, e.g., using `pytest -n auto tests/linearGaussian_snpe_test.py`. Note
that this will run for a few minutes and should result in passes and expected
fails (xfailed).
- Commit and push again until CI tests pass. Don't hesitate to ask for help by
  commenting on the PR.

## Contributing to the documentation
Most of the documentation for `sbi` is written in markdown and the website is
generated using `mkdocs` with `mkdocstrings`. To work on improvements of the
documentation, you should first run the command on your terminal
```
mkdocs serve
```
and open a browser on the page proposed by `mkdocs`. Now, whenever you
make changes to the markdown files of the documentation, you can see the results
almost immediately in the browser.

Note that the tutorials and examples are initially written in jupyter notebooks
and then converted to markdown programatically. To do so locally, you should run
```
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown ../tutorials/*.ipynb --output-dir docs/tutorial/
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown ../examples/*.ipynb --output-dir docs/examples/
```
